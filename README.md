## Installation

### Prerequisites

To get started with TailAdmin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed and set up:

- Node.js 18.x or later (recommended to use Node.js 20.x or later)

### Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   # or
   yarn install
